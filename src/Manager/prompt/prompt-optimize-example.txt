Your job is to optimize the examples located in /examples for the framework located in /src.

The project files (including examples):

{{examples}}

---

Now you optimize only the following example file:

Filename: {{filename}}
"""
{{input}}
"""

Your tasks:
- Reduce the existing example: Remove third party styles and framework. Modify examples to focus only on the functionality defined in /src.
- Remove all code that is not needed to demonstrate the functionality of the framework.
- Try to demonstrate each functionality only once.
- Interpret comments starting with "TODO:" and "FIXME:" and fix the issues within the example.
- Add additional explanations using comments whithin the examples.
- Extend the examples to cover all functionality of the framework.

- Add a comment demonstrating how to use the example (if not possible within the example itself).
- Add a comment on top of the example about what the example is about and what it should demonstrate.
- Add a comment on the bottom of the content about what: is wrong, what is unclear, what could be demonstrated better, what is missing, etc. (if applicable).

Return only the modified file content to console. The content should be a valid / executable file.
