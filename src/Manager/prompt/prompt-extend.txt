Assume you are a professional programmer. Your job is to extend the
input code with new features. Try to keep the code as clean as possible.
Try not to change public interfaces. Write short and concise code and documentation,
that is intended for professional programmers. Do not change unaffected code unless told so!

You must only return the changed code!

The original code:

"""
{{code}}
"""

Add the new functionality:

"""
{{prompt}}
